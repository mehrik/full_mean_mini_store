Start working on server get it running
Start up an index file
    angular
    skeleton
-----------------------
Set up Angular model and routes
Start up partials
    Dashboard, Products, Orders, Customers
-----------------------
Customers

 - Angular Routes
 - Server Models
 - Server Controllers
 - Server routes
 - $http.get/post connector

Orders
 - HTML Mockup
 - Factories
 - Controllers
 - Angular Routes
 - Server Models

 - Server routes

Products

 - Server routes

     <style type="text/css">
